# C++ interface of RTE+RRTMGP
This is a C++ interface to the Radiative Transfer for Energetics (RTE)
and Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCM applications Parallel (RRTMGP).

The original code is found at https://github.com/RobertPincus/rte-rrtmgp.

# Basic instructions
Building the source creates an executable `test_rte_rrtmgp`.
Two test cases are provided in directories `rfmip` and `rcemip`. In order to run those cases
follow the instructions in the `README.md` of those respective directories.

In general, in order to run a test case, make sure the following files are present in the
directory from which `test_rte_rrtmgp` is triggered:
1. Input file `rte_rrtmgp_input.nc` with atmospheric profiles of pressure, temperature, and gases.
2. Long wave coefficients file from original RTE+RRTMGP repository (in `rrtmgp/data`) as `coefficients_lw.nc`
3. Short wave coefficients file from original RTE+RRTMGP repository (in `rrtmgp/data`) as `coefficients_sw.nc`
